Do **NOT** under **ANY CIRCUMSTANCES** place an untrustworthy dll file into the 'dcpm-plugins' folder, the reason for this is that all dll files in that folder are loaded in order to retrieve the plugins from them regardless of whether they contain a plugin or not.

Plugin names should be relatively self explanatory.
