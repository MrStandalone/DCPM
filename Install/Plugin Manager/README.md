#Installation

To install the DeadCore Plugin Manager, simply copy the 4 dll's in this folder (replacing the existing Assembly-CSharp.dll in the process, make a backup if you want to revert back to original) into your `DeadCore Install Directory/DeadCore_Data/Managed` and start the game.

If all went well then you should hear a beep and when you press ~ an in game console should appear.

To install plugins simply go to the plugins folder of this repo and download the contents of that folder and copy it into the `dcpm-plugins` folder that will be created when you launch DeadCore with the DCPM enabled.
